## Support development

A lot of work has gone into building this app. It is provided for free and open-source. If you like it, please consider donating to support the development.  
Ideally, I would like to publish the app on the App Store but for enrolling in Apple's developer program there is a fee of 99$ per year.

## Click'N'Load

⚠️ ANDROID ONLY  

The app supports adding downloads via Click'N'Load. You can start the service via the `+` button once you selected a server and configured your Click'N'Load settings. Due to background limitations on iOS this is only available for Android. This is an experimental feature and might not work reliably.
